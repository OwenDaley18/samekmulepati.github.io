# Pacman Path finder algorithms

Implemented BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* with multiple heuristics in order to find solutions/paths for pacman to move towards. Used a multiple level perceptron in order to train a pacman client which copied behavior of multiple test actions.

## Installation

Download and utilize a miniconda or anaconda python 2.* environment to run the application, once files opened in conda use the commands listed for each of the following sections of code. 

https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html


## Usage
  To start and play a game as the clinet run the command below, this does not utilize any of the algorithms.
python pacman.py

For bfs, dfs or ucs on a list of maps use the following commands: 

```
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5
python eightpuzzle.py
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs
python pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p StayEastSearchAgent
python pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic 
python pacman.py -l tinyCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem
python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem
python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p AStarCornersAgent -z 0.5
python pacman.py -l testSearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent
python pacman.py -l trickySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent
python pacman.py -l bigSearch -p ClosestDotSearchAgent -z .5 
python pacman.py -l bigSearch -p ApproximateSearchAgent -z .5 -q 
```

Which will out put the listed map with the path found ex.
