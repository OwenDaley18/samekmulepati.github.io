# HMM Algorithms

The hidden markov model is represented as a system of several componenets. These components are made utilizing the Forward Algorithm and Viterbi Algorithm. 
### Forward Algorithm
![Part1](https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=B'_{t}(s^{_{j}})&space;=&space;\sum_{i&space;=&space;1}^{n&space;-&space;1}a_{ij}\cdot&space;B_{t&space;-&space;1}(s_{i}))

The "forward simulation" phase which is used to extimate the next step's belief vector for B'_t.
